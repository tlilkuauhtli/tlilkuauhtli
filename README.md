## Hello ðŸ‘‹ ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=tlilkuauhtli&color=blue)
I'm Tlilkuauhtli,

My current interests are focused on human motion analysis, artificial intelligence, computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, physics-based simulations, and data mining and data transformation.

I have worked creating Face Recognition systems and ASR systems using Python as main programming language, but also have experience with C# and SQL.
